# FinReport: Explainable Stock Earnings Forecasting via News Factor Analyzing Model

## Overview

FinReport is a research-oriented system designed to forecast stock earnings by analyzing both technical indicators and financial news. It leverages a multi-factor model implemented in PyTorch that integrates three key modules:

- **News Factorization:**  
  Extracts and processes features from financial news—including sentiment analysis using FinBERT and event extraction via AllenNLP with domain-specific keyword rules. The system also supports (optional) aggregation of multiple news items over time to yield an overall news factor.

- **Return Forecasting:**  
  Uses historical stock data (with automatically renamed technical indicator columns) and domain-specific proxies (e.g., market value for size) to predict returns via an LSTM model. The model hyperparameters (including sequence length, hidden size, dropout, etc.) are loaded from a YAML configuration file.

- **Risk Assessment:**  
  Evaluates risk using advanced metrics. It computes EGARCH-based volatility estimates, maximum drawdown, and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) via historical simulation. A combined risk-adjusted ratio (expected return divided by volatility) is also computed to assess performance from a risk perspective.

Additionally, the system computes comprehensive regression metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²) to evaluate prediction accuracy. The model's performance is visualized through detailed distribution plots and aggregate summaries.

The final output is a polished HTML report that presents predictions, detailed technical factors (with conditional styling for key numeric values), and risk metrics. In parallel, comprehensive performance metrics are printed in the terminal and saved in heatmaps for further analysis.

## Features

- **Data Integration:**  
  Combines historical stock data with technical indicators (whose column names are automatically renamed for consistency) and processed news text.

- **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
  Trains an LSTM-based model using time-series data with a fixed sequence length. Hyperparameters are loaded from a YAML file, and evaluation includes robust regression metrics.

- **Enhanced Feature Engineering:**  
  - **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses FinBERT (via Hugging Face) to compute a sentiment score.
  - **Event Extraction:** Uses AllenNLP's SRL model (with domain-specific keyword rules) to compute an event factor.
  - **Extra Factors:** Internal proxies (e.g., market value) are used to compute factors such as Market, Size, Valuation, Profitability, Investment, News Effect, and (if available) RSI, MFI, and BIAS factors.

- **Advanced Risk Assessment:**  
  - **EGARCH Volatility Forecasting:** Computes conditional volatility and approximate VaR.
  - **Additional Risk Metrics:** Calculates maximum drawdown and CVaR (Expected Shortfall) using historical simulation.
  - **Risk-Adjusted Ratio:** A simple measure (expected return divided by volatility) is computed.

- **Dynamic Report Generation:**  
  - Generates individual HTML reports for each stock and combines them into a single multi-stock HTML page.
  - Reports use conditional styling: bullet labels are blue, while key numeric values (e.g., "1%", "0.5%") are highlighted in green (for positive effects) or red (for negative effects).

- **Logging & Visualization:**  
  - Detailed logging is implemented (row counts, raw prediction statistics, target return distributions) to aid in debugging and performance analysis.
  - Terminal output includes a tabular summary of regression metrics.
  - Heatmaps of metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²) are generated and saved as images for visual performance analysis.
  - Prediction distribution visualizations help analyze how well predictions match ground truth values.
  - Aggregate visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of model performance across all stocks.

- **Modular Design:**  
  The code is organized into modules for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, sentiment analysis, extra factor computation, risk modeling, hyperparameter tuning, and report generation.

## Model Performance Results

The regression model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities across most stocks:

- **Strong Correlation**: Achieved a correlation of r = 0.948 between predictions and true values, with predictions closely following the ideal prediction line.

- **Error Distribution**: Errors are well-distributed and centered slightly above zero (mean error = 0.109), with most errors falling between -0.5 and 0.5.

- **Key Metrics**:
  - Average RMSE = 0.2546 (reasonably low)
  - Average MAE = 0.2433 (consistent with RMSE)
  - Average R² = 0.5515 (the model explains about 55% of the variance)

- **Stock-Specific Performance**:
  - Top performers: Several stocks show R² values above 0.95, including 000333.SZ, 002352.SZ, 001669.SH, and 600519.SH
  - Only a few problematic stocks, primarily 601727.SH with a negative R²
  - Notable clustering in predictions at true values of 0, 1, and 2, indicating the model has learned important patterns

The regression approach has proven to be significantly more effective than the classification approach, providing more nuanced and accurate predictions for stock returns.

```

### 2. Train the Model

Run the training script:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

This script:

### 3. Evaluate and Generate Reports

```bash
python src/evalute.py
```

The evaluation script:

- Creates individual HTML reports for each stock
- Combines reports into a single multi-stock HTML page
- Saves performance metric heatmaps

### 4. Tune Hyperparameters (Optional)

```bash
python src/hyperparameter.py
```

This script performs grid search using time-series cross-validation to find optimal hyperparameters.

## Performance & Debugging

- **Early Stopping and Validation:**  
  The training process monitors validation loss and stops when no further improvement is observed, preventing overfitting and ensuring model generalization.

- **Prediction Distribution Analysis:**  
  Visualization of prediction distributions helps analyze how well the model predicts continuous return values and identify any systematic biases.

- **Comprehensive Metrics:**  
  Regression metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²) provide a holistic view of model performance, with R² specifically indicating how much variance in returns the model explains.

- **Robust Handling of Edge Cases:**  
  Special handling is implemented for stocks with limited data, ensuring reliable metrics even in challenging scenarios.

## Future Improvements

- **Cross-Validation Implementation:**  
  Implement k-fold cross-validation for more robust performance estimation and to reduce sensitivity to specific train-test splits.

- **Return Forecasting Enhancements:**  
  Integrate classical multi-factor approaches (e.g., Fama–French factors) or alternative architectures (e.g., Transformers) for improved return predictions.

- **Risk Modeling Refinements:**  
  Experiment with alternative distributions in the EGARCH model, incorporate additional risk metrics, or visualize risk dynamics over time.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Develop a web-based dashboard for real-time analysis and interactive visualization of model performance and risk metrics.

- **Automated Data Pipeline:**  
  Build a pipeline to automatically update and preprocess new stock data to keep the model and reports current.
